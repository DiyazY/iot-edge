To evaluate and assign a criticality score to each check in the kube-bench report, we can base the score on the security impact of each issue. The categorization of the criticality follows:

- **5 (Critical):** Directly impacts the security of the cluster or leaves it vulnerable to severe attacks (e.g., unauthorized access, privilege escalation).
- **4 (High):** Significant impact but not immediately exploitable without other misconfigurations (e.g., weak permissions).
- **3 (Moderate):** Moderate security impact that requires specific conditions to exploit.
- **2 (Low):** Minor security implications or recommendations for best practices.
- **1 (Info):** Recommendations for non-critical changes.

This distribution of scores highlights the most critical aspects that directly impact the security of your cluster, such as file permissions, secure configurations, and proper authorization modes. It is essential to address these critical issues promptly to ensure the security of your Kubernetes environment.


Now, we can calculate the Security Score for the particular distribution by employing the following formula:

``` \begin{math}{Score} = \sum (\text{Criticality Weight}) \times \text{Result Coefficient} \end{math}

Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Result Coefficient: Assigned to PASS (1), FAIL (-1), WARN (0.5).
        \item Criticality Weight: Weights assigned based on the importance of the check.
    \end{itemize}
```
